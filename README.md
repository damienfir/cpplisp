# cpplisp

A small Lisp dialect interpreter written in C++

# How to build and run

Use common CMake build steps

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

For the moment, **cpplisp** does not have an interpreter or a script reader, it only has tests to confirm that the language is correctly implemented.
